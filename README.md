Ideas for cool projects

Each project is described as an [issue](https://github.com/neuropoly/idea-projects/issues). 

Please use labels to help filter projects.

The status of projects (untouched, ongoing, finished) could be followed using the [Kanban project management](https://github.com/orgs/neuropoly/projects/3/views/1).
